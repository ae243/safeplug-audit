\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This security audit of Safeplug shows a few holes in their promises of complete security and anonymity, as might be expected when the device meets the real world.  The network analysis shows taht the device accesses Tor as expected, and without too much cost to user experience.  However, the vulnerability of SSH access and the RPC server are a cause for concern.  We plan to continue investigating the avenues of future work identified in this study.
