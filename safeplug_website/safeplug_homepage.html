		<h3>Why Safeplug?</h3>
		<p>
			You wouldn’t post your home address just anywhere online. So why give it out to every website you visit? When you browse the Internet, every site you visit knows your IP address (a unique number that identifies your computer on the Internet) which can easily reveal your physical location and home address. This information could be accessed, hacked or even sold, exposing your identity and location to unknown parties and putting your family at risk. With Safeplug, you can effectively stop websites from knowing or logging who you are and where you live. Safeplug sets up in 60 seconds and allows you to use your existing web browser, and even your phone, to browse the Internet with complete anonymity and peace of mind.

			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<div id="ppq_0" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;0&#39;)">How does Safeplug work?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a0" class="ppprod_qa hidden">Safeplug uses the Tor network to secure your Internet connection. Tor works by routing your Internet traffic through a series of random destinations, much like driving a twisty, complicated route to throw off someone who is following you, making it impossible for websites and organizations to identify the source or destination of Internet traffic. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en" target="_blank">Learn more about Tor here</a>.</div>
			<div id="ppq_1" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;1&#39;)">How does Safeplug prevent organizations from learning my location?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a1" class="ppprod_qa hidden">The critical piece of information that an organization or individual needs to determine where you live is your IP address. Your IP address is a unique number that can be traced and used to learn who you are, where you live and even what websites you visit. Safeplug protects you and your family by concealing your IP address from the sites you visit. While using Safeplug, websites you visit cannot store information that identifies you on their servers where it is vulnerable to be accessed by the site’s owners, or hacked by malicious attackers.</div>
			<div id="ppq_6" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;6&#39;)">Do I need to install anything on my computer?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a6" class="ppprod_qa hidden">Safeplug does not require any additional software to be installed on your computer, and is compatible with any modern Internet browser that you already use. We support Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and many others. If you are having difficultly with your Safeplug, make sure you are running the latest version of your browser.</div>
			<div id="ppq_2" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;2&#39;)">Does Pogoplug or Safeplug have any official relationship with the Tor Project?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a2" class="ppprod_qa hidden">While Safeplug does not have any official relationship to the Tor Project, we love the work that they do and are excited to see how Safeplug can expand and improve Tor’s network.</div>
			<div id="ppq_3" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;3&#39;)">Is Safeplug for everyone?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a3" class="ppprod_qa hidden">You don’t need to be an international super-spy to use anonymous browsing. We believe that everyone should have the right to protect themselves from websites and organizations that track online activities.</div>
			<div id="ppq_4" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;4&#39;)">How secure is Safeplug?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a4" class="ppprod_qa hidden">The short answer is “extremely”. The slightly longer answer is that no method of security can ever be 100% secure 100% of the time. Tor (the technology behind the Safeplug device) is currently regarded as the most secure method of browsing the Internet anonymously available today. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en" target="_blank">Learn more about Tor</a>.</div>
			<div id="ppq_5" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;5&#39;)">Does Safeplug slow down my browsing?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a5" class="ppprod_qa hidden">While using Safeplug, it is likely that you will notice reductions in your overall Internet speed and page-loading times. This is because your Internet traffic is being bounced to computers across the globe to make your Internet browsing impossible to trace. The good news is that the more people use Tor the faster the service runs, so by using Safeplug you are helping the Internet community protect itself from tracking and surveillance. As Safeplug and Tor gain in popularity, speeds will continue to increase. Additionally, Safeplug can be quickly turned on and off.</div>
			<div id="ppq_7" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;7&#39;)">Can I use Safeplug on my phone?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a7" class="ppprod_qa hidden">Yes. You must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network that your Safeplug is connected to. Safeplug currently supports iOS and Android phones.</div>
			<div id="ppq_8" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;8&#39;)">Is Tor used for illegal activities?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a8" class="ppprod_qa hidden">While there will always be a few bad apples in every bushel, Tor is overwhelmingly used by law-abiding citizens. Tor was originally developed by the United States Navy and is used world-wide by journalists, businesses, activists and ordinary people who value privacy and want to protect themselves and their families online.</div>
			<div id="ppq_9" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;9&#39;)">Is there a backdoor in Tor?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a9" class="ppprod_qa hidden">No. Tor has never had and never will have a backdoor as this would compromise the security of Tor’s users.</div>
			<div id="ppq_10" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;10&#39;)">Why does Google show up in foreign languages?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a10" class="ppprod_qa hidden">Google uses geo-location to determine where you are and serves you results in the languages it thinks you are most likely to use. With Safeplug, your location is kept secret so Google may think you are someplace that you are not. To get around this problem you can use <a href="http://google.com/ncr" target="_blank">http://google.com/ncr</a> or simply visit your country’s specific Google site. For example, the U.S. Google site is located at <a href="http://google.com/ncr" target="_blank">http://google.com/us</a>. </div>
			<div id="ppq_11" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;11&#39;)">Can I use ad-blocking software with Safeplug?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a11" class="ppprod_qa hidden">Safeplug has ad-blocking software built-in out of the box. No need for extra installations or downloads.</div>
			<div id="ppq_12" class="ppprod_q" onclick="return toggleQ(&#39;12&#39;)">How can I ensure that my browsing is really anonymous?</div>
			<div id="ppq_a12" class="ppprod_qa hidden">To ensure that your online activity cannot be tracked, we recommend that you clear your cookies between anonymous browsing sessions. Cookies could allow a site or organization to trace your Internet activity back to you. Additionally, we recommend disabling browser plugins like Flash Player and QuickTime. Using browser plugins with Safeplug could present a security risk to you while browsing.</div>
